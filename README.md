# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

A microservice made with Express.JS that gets request's header info.

A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your IP address in the ipaddress key, the preferred language in the language key and your software in the software key.

Example Output:

{"ipaddress":"159.20.14.100","language":"en-US,en;q=0.5",
"software":"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0"}
